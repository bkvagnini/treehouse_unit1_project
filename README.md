This is the Treehouse Python Tech Degree Unit 1 project for Brian K. Vagnini.
This is a number guessing game, guessing from 1 to 20.
It will tally up the number of guesses that you tried, as well as tell you whether you are high or low.
It will, of course, tell you if you guessed correctly.
You would have to be EXCEEDINGLY bored to want to play this game.
(Seriously, get a friend, get a life, get another hobby...)
